    <p class="text">
        Words is an ongoing personal project that aims to explain the meaning of rare English words
        through web graphics and animation. By trying different techniques, I can improve my front end
        skills and learn new words as well.<br>
        I spend a lot of time conducting online research for words, handpicking the ones that are truly useful,
        or something that we can relate to in our every day life before finally coming up with a simple animation
        to make it easier for people to understand. These factors make the progress quite slow, but its fun, different and
        extremely rewarding.
