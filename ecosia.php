      Ecosia is a search engine that allows its users to help plant trees.
      One of the goals for this mini-project is to mobile-optimize the website while keeping the welcoming and illustrative theme that everyone already loves.
      Changing some of the text also allowed visitors to obtain immediate answers to their questions about the project.
