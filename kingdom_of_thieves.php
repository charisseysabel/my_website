        <h1>The Kingdom of Thieves</h1>

    <p class="text">
        The Kingdom of Thieves was born after participating in the National Novel Writing Month, more commonly known as NaNoWrimo.
        All the winners had the chance to self-publish their novels for free if they beat the fifty thousand word mark. A dream for every writer!<br>
        Using the skills I earned as a graphic designer, I designed my book and drew illustrations inspired by Tolkien and other fantasy books that I loved.
        Being able to hold a book that was formed from my imagination gives an unmatchable feeling of accomplishment.

    <p class="text">
        Illustrating the cover of the book was a fun and challenging experience.
        By adding a mysterious character to match the title, the book can attract attention to readers.
        Even my pen name, J. Drowseth, has a little backstory; it was the name of my very first novel character years before the Kingdom of Thieves was written.
        I tend to jumble plain English words when making up a name. Drowseth came from the words, "the sword".

    <p class="text">
        The map was an actual drawing that was scanned and cleaned before inserting in the book.
        Adding it gives more life and keeps the readers from getting lost in a fantasy world.

    <p class="text">
        Writing fifty thousand words in a month eliminates the tempting task of going back and forth to edit and perfect the grammar.
        Even though the story of the Kingdom of Thieves is far from over, its always nice to open the book and begin the journey again.
