      The Kingdom of Thieves was born after participating in the National Novel Writing Month, more commonly known as NaNoWrimo.
      All the winners had the chance to self-publish their novels for free if they beat the fifty thousand word mark. A dream for every writer!<br>
      Using the skills I earned as a graphic designer, I designed my book and drew illustrations inspired by Tolkien and other fantasy books that I loved. Being able to hold a book that was formed from my imagination gives an unmatchable feeling of accomplishment.<br>
      The story, however, is not finished yet.

        Illustrating the cover of the book was a fun and challenging experience.
        By adding a mysterious character to the intruiging title, the book can attract attention to readers.
        Even my pen name, J. Drowseth, has a little backstory; it was the name of my very first novel character years before the Kingdom of Thieves was written.
        I tend to jumble plain English words when making up a name. Drowseth came from the words, "the sword".

    <section class="text">
        The map was an actual drawing that was scanned and cleaned up before inserting in the book.
        Adding it gives more life and keeps the readers from getting lost in a fantasy world.

      Writing fifty thousand words in a month eliminates the tempting task of going back and forth to edit and perfect the grammar, but its always nice to open the book and begin the journey again.</p>
