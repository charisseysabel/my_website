                  A brochure to promote a supercar by Rezvani Automotive Designs.
                  I was lucky that they gave me the freedom to design the brochure in any way that I think is best which gave me the opportunity get down and be creative. With it being my first freelance work as a junior designer, I made sure that the client was satisfied with my work.
