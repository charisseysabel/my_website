    The idea for this application came from my personal desire to live a zero waste life.
    But just like every other life-changing decision, to start is hard. So I'd like to build this application
    to simplify the transition, our lives and ultimately, to help the environment. I want to make this app
    for myself and for those willing to make a change.
