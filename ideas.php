    <p class="text">
      The idea for this application came from my personal desire to live a zero waste life.
      But just like every other life-changing decision, to start is hard and maintaining a way of life different from others is harder.
      So I'd like to build this application to simplify our lives, the transition, and ultimately, to help the environment.
      I want to make this app for myself and for those willing to make a change.
