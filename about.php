      <p>A really brief history</p>
  </div>


  <p>Growing up, I never really knew what I wanted to do with my life. Yeah, I was one of those people who
    stressed a lot about it. My first ambition was to become a ballerina (no joke), then a nurse, then a chef.
    I basically had my mind set on becoming a chef. I do enjoy cooking.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fast forward a few years later, we left the bustling city of Manila to travel halfway across the world
    and move to the boot-shaped country, where I am right now. One day, I saw a graphic design course in town.
    I signed up and was admitted, even if I barely knew Italian that time. And for the next two years, graphic design
    basically took over my life. It still does; its something that would stick with me forever.</p>
  <p>
      Programming came shortly after that. I enjoyed every bit of time I spent learning how to code.
      I've come a long way by teaching myself. It's a wild ride and its awesome.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like being busy. When I'm not on the computer, you can probably find me breaking the routine, trying something new.
